# Safe House ‚Äì IoT-Based Home Security and Fire Monitoring System

Safe House is an Arduino-based IoT project designed to enhance home security and fire safety. It uses sensors to detect motion and flames and responds by controlling doors, windows, and an extinguisher through servo motors. The system is controlled remotely using a custom-built MIT App Inventor mobile app via Bluetooth.

---

## Objective

To develop a smart, responsive, and low-cost home monitoring system that:
- Detects unauthorized motion
- Identifies fire hazards early
- Controls doors, windows, fans, and extinguishers automatically
- Allows remote control via Bluetooth using a mobile app
